If you read the docs you linked to you'll see that it says attack(target) and that target is an object. Currently you're passing attack() a string, "Player 3". In order for the attack function to actually target something you need to give it an object. Try something like this:

Game.spawns.Spawn1.createCreep([Game.ATTACK, Game.MOVE],'Attacker1');
var attacker = Game.creeps.Attacker1;
var enemies= attacker.room.find(Game.HOSTILE_CREEPS);
attacker.moveTo(enemies[0]);
attacker.attack(enemies[0]);
This code:

Creates a creep named Attacker1 and assigns the object to a var named attacker
Uses attacker's find() function to find all enemies and assigns them to an array named enemies
Moves your attacker to the first enemy in the array (.attack() only works close range)
Attacks the first enemy in the array of enemies
